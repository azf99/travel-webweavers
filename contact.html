            Cultural, Adventure, Religious, Wildlife, Pilgrimage etc. and you can 
            buy them on as it is basis. If however you feel that these tours need to
             be fine-tuned to coincide with your flight schedule, and if you need to
             add or reduce a night in any city, then you can send us your request 
            and our travel experts will get back to you shortly with necessary

            <br>
            
            <strong>Q. Is the company really reliable? What is the profile of the company?&nbsp;</strong><br>
            
            <strong>A.</strong>&nbsp;We suggest you check our profile by clicking on
             'ABOUT US' to know more about us. Being the No.-1 Destination 
            Management Company in India, we at Top Travel &amp; Tours have been

            America, Middle East, South Africa, Far East, South East Asia, Australia
             &amp; New Zealand etc. are working with us for our excellent support in
             terms of competitive rates, efficient handling and product knowledge. 
            We have been awarded various prestigious awards by Department of 
            Tourism, Government of India.&nbsp;<br>
            
            <br>
            
            <strong>Q. How many offices does Top Travel &amp; Tours have in India?</strong><br>
            
            <strong>A.</strong>&nbsp;Head Office in Delhi, Corporate &amp; Marketing
             Office in Gurgaon, Top Travel &amp; Tours has a wide network of 
            professionally managed offices all over India and in Nepal, Bhutan, Sri 
            Lanka &amp; Maldives. We also have our branch office in Bodhgaya &amp; 
            Varanasi. In all the small and remote locations where Top Travel &amp; 
            Tours does not have a branch of its own, an associate agent or sub- 
            agent renders the services. A network of more than 52 such agents &amp; 
            sub- agents is also a part of our network.&nbsp;<br>
            
            <br>
            
            <strong>Q. How do we settle the payment? Is there an advance deposit required?<br>
            
            A.</strong>&nbsp;We insist on a nominal deposit of 10% of the total tour
             cost (if the condition differs, we will inform you accordingly) to be 
            sent to us as soon as the itinerary and the price have been finalized. 
            This is an authorization for us to go ahead with the reservations. A lot
             of times we need to shell out money to block rooms in small hotels 
            which do not entertain travel agents, to buy train tickets or domestic 
            air tickets, to pay for reserving berth in trains like Palace on Wheels,
             Royal Rajasthan on Wheels etc. Hence we insist on a token amount. The 
            balance however has to be settled one month prior to your arrival in 
            India. The money can be paid by the payment gateway on the site, or 
            through credit card, through a wire transfer to our bank account etc.<br>
            
            <br>
            
            <strong>Q. Is the information I give on the net safe?&nbsp;</strong><br>
            
            <strong>A.</strong>&nbsp;Any correspondence exchanged between you and 
            Top Travel &amp; Tours will be kept confidential and not outsourced to 
            any third party under any circumstances. The credit card details you 
            provide are safe since our Payment Gateway is approved. Moreover your 
            profile (name, Email ID, address, Telephone number) will be used only to
             communicate with you in regards to the services you are buying or 
            availing. At no time will this profile be misused.&nbsp;<br>
            
            <br>
            
            <strong>Q. Does Top Travel &amp; Tours provide reliable information?</strong><br>

            options and not a full fledged tour or a holiday, then you may click on 
            'Hotel in India' and you can choose the hotel you would like to stay at
